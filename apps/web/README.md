# 1git website

An Astro landing page alongside the native app, adapted from Taada's cloudy
desktop, MacBook preview, spacious feature cards, and large footer wordmark.
The app preview is HTML/CSS, with sample files, history, light/dark appearance,
and Mac/SSH machine selection. It never reads local repositories or connects to
GitHub or an SSH machine. Reloading resets the preview.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev:web
bun run build:web
```

From this folder:

```sh
bun run check-types
bun run test
bun run build
bun run preview
```

Astro generates static HTML and small browser scripts in `dist/`. No React,
database, application accounts, or server rendering are needed. `tsconfig.json`
selects browser types; `tsconfig.infra.json` checks the Bun deployment config,
Cloudflare handler and offline routing tests separately.

## Alchemy and Cloudflare

The website uses its own `1git-website` stack and Cloudflare deployment state,
following Taada's infrastructure pattern. Alchemy and Effect match the versions
already used by 1git's release infrastructure. Scripts use the existing
`personal` Alchemy profile, with credentials outside the repository.

```sh
bun run deploy:preview
bun run plan
bun run deploy
```

Every command builds Astro before Alchemy reads `dist/`. Preview has a separate
Workers URL and no production route. Production installs a `git.1bye.dev/*`
route in front of the existing Downloads Worker's custom domain; it does not
replace that domain, edit the release stack, or manage its R2 bucket/publisher.

Cloudflare serves the static files directly. Only `/download`, `/appcast.xml`,
and valid versioned release archives pass through the small edge handler to the
existing custom-domain origin. Redirects, response headers and streamed archive
bodies are preserved, while browser cookies and authorization are not forwarded.
Cloudflare route subrequests bypass the route and reach its custom-domain origin,
so the pass-through does not recurse. See [Cloudflare route precedence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/#background).

The custom domain must remain attached to the release Worker. Do not move it to
this stack: installed apps and the website rely on that origin. Production route
behavior still needs verification after the first actual deployment; offline
tests substitute the Cloudflare assets binding and the release origin.

## Assets

The responsive cloud WebPs and optimized MacBook bezel come from the user's
Taada website. The 1git ribbon is copied from
`docs/branding/macos-icon/Ribbon-Final.svg`. Apple bezel provenance and usage
references are retained in `assets/macbook-source.json`. No original large
photographs, PSDs, DMGs, or source image packs are shipped.
